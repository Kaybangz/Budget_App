# Program built with React

# What the program does
This is a simple program that helps you with budgeting. 

# How it works
1 - First deposit money by entering the amount in the "deposit" input box and click on the "deposit" button, the amount is then added to balance

2 - Enter the expense (i.e what you are budgeting for) and percentage(i.e the percentage that would be collected from the balance and assigned to the expense) in the input boxes and click on the "calculate" button to create the budget

3 - Once budget is created, you can click on the delete button(thrash icon) to delete the expense and return money back to balance.

# My goal for this project
* My primary goal was to reinforce my knowledge on the following concepts

1 - React hooks
2 - Passing down state and functions as props to child/children component(s).

# Folder structure
"component" folder is contained in the default "src" folder and the component folder contains the "Budget.js", "BudgetList.js" and" BudgetStyle.css".
